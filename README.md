U.S. Job market analysis: Ranking cities by job growth, salaries, and employment trends

#### **Overview**
This project analyzes employment trends, salary distributions, and job market growth across major U.S. cities using real data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 

It ranks cities based on a custom Job Market Index (JMI) score, normalizes salaries for cost-of-living adjustments, and visualizes insights through charts.

#### Features
- Real-world BLS Data - Extracted, cleaned, and analyzed without requiring an API key.
- Custom JMI score - Weighted scoring method ranks cities based on employment, salaries, job openings, and growth.
- Cost-of-living adjusted salaries - Provides a realistic comparison of purchasing power in different cities.
- Correlation analysis - Examines relationships between job growth and median salaries.
- Seaborn & Matplotlib visuals - formatted charts with proper labels and insights.

#### 📊 Visualizations

- Job market index Score - Ranking of cities based on multiple employment factors.
- Job growth rate comparison - Identifies fast-growing job markets.
- Median salary estimate by City - Shows income disparities across locations.
- Adjusted salary comparison - Evaluates salary differences after accounting for cost-of-living.
- Job growth vs. Salary scatter plot - Identifies trends in job market expansion vs. compensation.

#### Pre-processing/analysis
1.	Data collection: Downloaded BLS job market data for multiple U.S. cities.
2.	Data cleaning & processing: Filtered key employment factors (salaries, job growth, employment levels).
3.	Normalization & scoring: Used Min-Max scaling and weighted scores to compute the Job Market Index (JMI).
4.	Cost-of-living: Adjusted salaries based on estimated city cost-of-living indexes.
5.	Data visualization: Created detailed Seaborn & Matplotlib charts to present insights.
6.	Data structuring: Organized files into data, notebooks, visualizations, and app directories for clear maintainability.

#### Requirements
To run the analysis, install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
